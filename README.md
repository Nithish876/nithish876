#### Hope you guys are doing great,  
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile — here you'll find my dumb works 😶‍🌫️ (at least they’re not AI-generated!)

I have a deep passion for **computer vision** — not just as a tech, but as a tool to shape the future.  
I'm also fascinated by **space exploration** and the technologies that make it possible.  

To me, computer vision is a gateway to creating machines that can act autonomously — analyzing and exploring unknown environments, without relying on direct human presence. Imagine robots landing on distant planets, navigating terrains, recognizing obstacles, and making decisions — all powered by intelligent visual systems.

This is where science meets imagination, and where I want to build.

Feel free to explore, fork, or just laugh at my experiments! 🤓✨
