## 🧭 About

I'm a self-taught engineer with a product-first mindset. I design and build **fast, elegant, and scalable** software using the **JavaScript ecosystem** — from mobile apps to SaaS platforms.

I treat every project like a product, not a task — with sharp attention to architecture, UX, and maintainability.

**Core Values:**

* Precision > Polish
* Depth > Hype
* Autonomy > Convention

> I’m not trying to be everywhere. I’m trying to be excellent where I choose to be.
