I'm a self-taught developer building polished mobile apps using **React Native (Expo)** and **JavaScript**. My focus is on performance, clarity, and design precision — building products that feel fast, intuitive, and thoughtfully engineered.

I care deeply about clean architecture, smooth interactions, and writing code that scales.
