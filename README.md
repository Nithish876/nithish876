### 🚀 About Me

I’m an 18-year-old self-taught developer building sleek, animated, and high-performance mobile apps using **React Native + Expo**, and occasionally diving into **Kotlin (Native Android)**.

I build for real-world use — habit trackers, invoice generators, parenting tools, you name it. Every app is crafted with clean code, pixel-perfect UI, and professional logic that clients love.

- 🔥 Currently mastering: `React Native Animations`, `Firebase`, `Supabase`, `Expo Router v3`
- 📦 Also exploring: `Frontend Full Stack`, `Next.js`, `Tailwind`, `Node.js`
- 🎯 Career goal: Become a top 1% developer who can't be replaced by AI 🤖
- 🌕 Ultimate goal: Build tools that serve real humans, on Earth — and Mars 🌍🚀
